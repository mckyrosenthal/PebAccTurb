# PebAccTurb
Calculate the growth rates of planets through "pebble accretion," i.e. capture of small particles that interact strongly with the nebular gas, using the model of [Rosenthal et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06898). Introductory examples of using the code can be found [in this notebook](PebAcc_Turb_ex.ipynb).
